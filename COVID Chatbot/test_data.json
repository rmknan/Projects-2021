The study published in Wuhan, China compared blood types in 2,173 people in Wuhan and Shenzhen with COVID-19 to more than 3,600 healthy people in the same areas.\n\nIt showed people with type A blood are more likely to catch the virus and die from it. People with type O blood may be less likely to get COVID-19.\n\n\"If you are type A, there is no need to panic. It does not mean you will be infected 100 percent,\" researcher Gao Yingdai told the South China Morning Post. \"If you are type O, it does not mean you are absolutely safe, either. You still need to wash your hands and follow the guidelines issued by authorities.\"\"\n\nSo you might be less likely with type O, but you still are definitely able to get it.","Do Certain Blood Types Make You More or Less Likely To Get Covid?\n            \n\n                I saw something in the news about blood types and the chances of you getting covid19 based on those.

Studies in mice suggest that this may also be true for coronaviruses, though Covid-19 specifically has not been studied.\n\n“Their immune system may not initiate an appropriate response when it initially sees the virus,” Klein said.\n\nHormones can also play a role – oestrogen has been shown to increase antiviral responses of immune cells. And many genes that regulate the immune system are encoded on the X chromosome (of which men have one, and women have two) and so it is possible that some genes involved in the immune response are more active in women than in men.\n\nSex differences in the immune response to Covid-19 are likely to show up in antibody surveys that are currently under way across the world. Klein said she has already reviewed papers on this from Chinese teams, who have tracked blood samples from patients over the course of infection. “We can expect more on this soon,” she said.\n\nUltimately, Hawkes said, biology, lifestyle and behaviour are all likely to play a role.\"\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why\n\nI think they're going to be learning a lot about this virus for a long time. \n\nAll that said, as noted - none of us is safe, so be sure to wash your hands  and have a good day...   :-)","Do Certain Blood Types Make You More or Less Likely To Get Covid?\n            \n\n                I saw something in the news about blood types and the chances of you getting covid19 based on those.

  ["\"Am I at greater risk of developing severe illness should I be infected?\"\n\nHi, Arturo; this is my rough interpretation:\nBecause of your valve problem, with every beat there is some backflow of blood and so there is reduced blood flow going out. On top of that, by itself getting CoViD can make anybody's heart muscle perform less well; and so that also causes a reduced blood flow going out. Your total reduction of outgoing blood flow can therefore be greater than if you didn't have the valve problem.\n\n\nLet's see what the American cardiologist group says about ordinary flu:\n\"Acute viral infections have three categories of short-term effects on the cardiovascular system:\n...\n    Second, myocardial depression leading to heart failure.\n...\"\nfrom https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2020/03/01/08/42/feature-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-provides-potent-reminder-of-the-risk-of-infectious-agents\n\n\"Myocardial depression\" means the heart muscle isn't working so good. In sepsis from the CoV infection, the flood of inflammatory chemicals are involved in that. \"Heart failure\" means not pumping out enough blood. But the \"failure\" presumably can be temporary if heart muscle is not permanently damaged. However, the effect can still be devastating in the short term.\n\n\nNone of that, though, tells you HOW MUCH greater risk there is for you.","Mitral regurgitation  - am I at risk with COVID-19?\n            \n\n                Hello,\nI have mild-moderate mitral regurgitation (see enclosed description).

Another study from the New England Journal of Medicine examined 425 patients, finding that no one under the age of 15 had the virus. The WHO has reported that 2.4 per cent of cases were children under the age of 18, while only 0.2 per cent of cases were cases where children were seriously ill.\n“We don’t have to worry about our children dying,” says Bowdish.

It’s a move that she says is “excellent.”\n“Families [who may get infected] will come back from their March Break holiday and have two weeks before the kids end up back at school. Hopefully, that will be sufficient to slow down transmission,” she says.

Staying away from grandparents.\n“Grandparents are everyone’s defacto babysitter,” she says. “This is problematic because this virus infects older adults and causes them to become severely ill.” She suggests that parents find alternative childcare if they can.\nAnother prevention strategy is teaching children how to properly wash their hands.
